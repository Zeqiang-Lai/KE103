# Sequence-Labeling-with-Keras
*Author: Zeqiang Lai*

Note: all scripts must be run in `sequence-labeling-keras`

## Requirement
1. tensorflow
2. keras
3. (optional) [keras_contrib](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-contrib)
4. python3

## Quickstart

### Download dataset

We use semeval 2014 Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis [(ABSA)](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2014/task4/) dataset.

1. __Download the dataset__ `Laptop_Train_v2.xml` and `Restaurants_Train_v2.xml` on [Semeval](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2014/task4/index.php?id=data-and-tools) and save it under the `data/semeval` directory.

2. __Build the dataset__ Run the following script
```
python build_semeval_dataset.py
python build_vocab.py
python build_vocab.py --data_dir data/semeval/laptop
```
It will extract the sentences and labels from the dataset, split it into train/val/test and save it in a convenient format for our model.

*Debug* If you get some errors, check that you downloaded the right file and saved it in the right directory.

### Download embedding

1. __Download the general embedding__

2. __Download the domain embedding__

3. __Process the embeddings__ Run the following script
```
python build_embedding.py
```


### Training

We have some problems to save and reload a pretrained model. To see the result of experiment, you have to train a new model by yourself.

It costs no more than 5 minutes on CPU (even faster on GPU). Run the following scripts:

```
python train.py
```
